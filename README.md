# aoc2024

Solutions to Advent of Code 2024 in Rust.

- Solutions are in [`src/solutions`](src/solutions)
- Usage: `cargo run <day>`

> [!TIP]
> The standard `cargo run` command will build and run an unoptimized debug
> build. If you want to test how fast the solution is, you should create a
> release build and run that.
>
> ```sh
> cargo build --release
> time target/release/aoc2024 <day>
> ```
